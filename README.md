# A-quantitative-study-for-the-CLASSIFICATION-of-anxiety-stress-and-depression
The underlying aim of this project is to create a dynamic R Shiny application that would predict the likelihood of a person having the symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress (ASD Score) by them answering a set of questions.

## Requirements - 
Python Environment, R Studio

## Questions and Data source â€“

(If the above link does not work, you can find the data and the data dictionary of the same in the repository under the folder "Raw Data". 

The Project was a work for the course EAS 509 at the University at Buffalo.\
The powerpoints of every phase in the folder 'Documents" demonstrates the ongoing process in the various phases viz. Phase 1, 2 and 3.\
The folder "Data Cleaning" explains how we used Python to clean the data taken off kaggle and made it ready for our pipeline to run models thereby creating an interactive visualizer.\
The folder "Cluster Visualization" shows a few graphs of how the data was used to visualize the insights on various aspects. It contains .ipynb files where you can see the various graphs on how the ASD score varies in different sub sectors.

## Project Demonstration -
The working of the project is done via R and R studio by creating a Shiny App of the visualization. The folder "ASD Interactive Visualizer" has the files 'server.R' and 'ui.R' which is required to run the app. Also, a file of the cleaned data is uploaded to the folder as that is the data which has been used for the visualization.
